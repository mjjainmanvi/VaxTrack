VaxTrack is a comprehensive vaccination management system that allows users to register and log in as a patient, an admin, or a vaccine center. The system provides authentication for patients and centers via OTP using sessions in Firebase. The primary goal of VaxTrack is to create a centralized platform that enables efficient management of vaccination records, appointment scheduling, and vaccine stock monitoring. The target audience for VaxTrack includes individual users who seek to manage their vaccination information, vaccination centers that need to track and update patient vaccination status, and healthcare administrators responsible for overseeing the vaccination program.
